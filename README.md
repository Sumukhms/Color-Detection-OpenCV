# 🎨 Color Detection using OpenCV + CNN

This project demonstrates **single and multicolor detection** using OpenCV and a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
It can analyze images and make predictions on detected colors.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Detect colors in an image.
- Predict color classes using a trained CNN model (`cnn1.h5`).
- Extendable with more colors and datasets.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Numpy

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sumukhms/Color-Detection-OpenCV.git
   cd Color-Detection-OpenCV
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow keras

3. Run Image Analysis:

   python image_analyse.py

4. Run Prediction with CNN:

   python prediction.py

   📌 Notes

🔹cnn1.h5 is a pre-trained CNN model used for color classification.

🔹Update HSV ranges or retrain the model if you want to detect new colors.
